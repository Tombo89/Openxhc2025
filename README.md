# Openxhc2025

This is a rewrite of the OPEN HXC Project https://github.com/moonglow/openxhc

My goal was to implement the code into the actual Version of Cube ide, to rework the Display UI.
The Code could be messy, because I have very little knowledge about coding. 99% of this Code was written from Chat GPT5.

There are some minor things that need to be fixed:

- Long Press of a Button = Repeat
- Clean up the Display Ui Spacing
- Clean up MC/WC Coordinates font for better visibility
- Include the Stepmultiplyer into the UI

At this stage the A Axis is not implementet, but this would be an easy fix. I leave this to someone else, because for me it is not needed.
This Code features less Buttons then the original one. You can select which buttons you have implemented to send the right Codes.

The Hardware part of this Projekt is still in developement. 
There will be a 3d Printed Case, Custom PCB which hold all the components, and custom front Foil.
